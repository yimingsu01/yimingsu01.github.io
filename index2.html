        <p>One of my passions is to design games. Games provide experiences through its unique interactive nature. It is also an artform for self-expression, just like all other artforms. </p>
        <p><br> All games here are designed and developed by me, collaborators are specified and elaborated as well.</p>

        <h3>(Don't) Fear the Reaper</h3>
        <p>DFTR is a TTRPG that me and two other classmates (S and A) made for UChicago's one and only game design class: MADD 22322. DFTR unfolds a fictional galaxy where intergalactical travel has been achieved and popularized. The galaxies are populated by different civilizations. One day, the civilizations received news that an alleged impending doom approaches, where entities called "The Reapers" will come in 3 millenia and annihilate every living beings. An intergalactic counsel, formed by civilizations, has been organized to prepare for The Reapers. </p>

        <p><br>As a TTRPG, 3-4 players play as the founding civilizations in the counsel. They make their own flags/emblems, names, and species of their civilization. They are dealt with cards that represents events happening between them. Each card represents a certain amount of time between "now" to "3 millenia later," and it is up to the players to decide whether to cooperate and fight their last battle, or fight against each other till the end of the world.</p>

        <p><br>We encourage the player to make a story out of this 3 million years. However, the "Reaper Card," representing the arrival of the Reapers, is hidden in the card stack in random order. Its arrival will be sudden, and the player won't be able to know when.</p>

        <p><br>It is very clear from the name "The Reaper" that this game takes inspirations from the Mass Effect trilogy. Instead of a space opera-sque ending or story, I intended to only take the different species and the idea of a certain impending doom as the inspirations. <br></p>

        <p><br>We all loved the song <i>(Don't Fear) the Reaper</i>, thanks to S introducing this song to me. The theme of the song also fitted the game very well.</p>

        <h3>Cyberspace</h3>
        <p> <b>Notice that I have the entire idea and message <i>before</i> I watch the Matrix trilogy.</b> It dawned on me how obvious the message of <i>Cyberspace</i> would seem to be after I watched the Matrix trilogy.</p>
