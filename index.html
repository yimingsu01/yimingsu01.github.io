            <p>Yiming is a first-year Computer Science PhD at The University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign. He currently works with Prof. Tianyin Xu on <b>cloud systems reliability</b>.</p>

            <p>In the past, he had been working with Prof. Shan Lu on Software Reliability projects, such as bug analysis and bug finding. He is most proud of his work as the <b>first author</b> <i>HotGPT: How to Make Software Documentation More Useful with a Large Language Model?</i>, which is accepted in HotOS '23.</p>

            <p>For most of his time at UChicago, he had committed to teaching assistantships for introductory CS courses. He taught data structures and programming design to first- and second-year students. Fun facts: he co-authored the first guide on WSL for intro CS courses when VM access was down. He was one of the <b>last</b> TAs to teach the last offering of CMSC 15100: Introduction to Computer Science I in <b>Racket</b>. He was also one of the <b>first</b> TAs to teach the new iteration of CMSC 15100 (now 14100 and 14200): Introduction to Computer Science II in <b>Python</b>. Very fortunately, he was a TA for <b>all offerings of CMSC 14200 possible</b>  when he was at UChicago.</p>
