                    Way back when I used to play flash games on the internet for hours and think that I would never die. <br>
                    Today flash games no longer exist. And I'm now quite sure of my death.

                    We were on the other side of the barricade a few years ago, man. 
                    Coming to these shows, seeing our favorite bands and having the dreams. <br>
                    Just persevere, believe in yourself. <br>

                This is one of my favorite Lives of Linkin Park. They played it extremely well, and the crowd did not disappoint either.
                RIP Chester.

                -- <b>Lauren Mayberry</b>, vocalist of the pop band CHVRCHES, in their 2014 T in the Park Live, watch <a href="https://youtu.be/HeAv1kerDZc?si=ZD2eFQgR7-3irq2Z&t=2794">here</a>.
                I periodically listen to some synth-pop/electric music from around 2013-14, like <i>Clarify</i> by Zedd. 
                CHVRCHES wrote <i>We Sink</i> which is featured in <i>FIFA 14</i> (My favorite soccer game). 
                They also wrote <i>Warning Call</i> which is featured in <i>Mirror's Edge</i> (One of the games that have profound impact on how I view games).
